            <h1>STARS</h1>

            <p>A star develops from a giant, slowly rotating cloud that is made up entirely or almost entirely of
                hydrogen and helium. Due to its own gravitational pull, the cloud begins to collapse inward, and as it
                shrinks, it spins more and more quickly, with the outer parts becoming a disk while the innermost parts
                become a roughly spherical clump.</p>
            <p>According to NASA, this collapsing material grows hotter and denser, forming a ball-shaped protostar.
                When the heat in the protostar reaches about 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit (1 million degrees Celsius),
                atomic nuclei that normally repel each other start fusing together, and the star ignites. Nuclear fusion
                converts a small amount of the mass of these atoms into extraordinary amounts of energy — for instance,
                1 gram of mass converted entirely to energy would be equal to an explosion of roughly 22,000 tons of
                TNT.</p>
            <p>The life cycles of stars follow patterns based mostly on their initial mass. These include
                intermediate-mass stars such as the sun, with half to eight times the mass of the sun, high-mass stars
                that are more than eight solar masses, and low-mass stars a tenth to half a solar mass in size. The
                greater a star's mass, the shorter its lifespan generally is, according to NASA. Objects smaller than a
                tenth of a solar mass do not have enough gravitational pull to ignite nuclear fusion — some might become
                failed stars known as brown dwarfs.</p>
            <p>An intermediate-mass star begins with a cloud that takes about 100,000 years to collapse into a protostar
                with a surface temperature of about 6,750 degrees F (3,725 degrees C). After hydrogen fusion starts, the
                result is a T-Tauri star, a variable star that fluctuates in brightness. This star continues to collapse
                for roughly 10 million years until its expansion due to energy generated by nuclear fusion is balanced
                by its contraction from gravity, after which point it becomes a main-sequence star that gets all its
                energy from hydrogen fusion in its core.</p>
            <p>The greater the mass of such a star, the more quickly it will use its hydrogen fuel and the shorter it
                stays on the main sequence. After all the hydrogen in the core is fused into helium, the star changes
                rapidly — without nuclear radiation to resist it, gravity immediately crushes matter down into the
                star's core, quickly heating the star. This causes the star's outer layers to expand enormously and to
                cool and glow red as they do so, rendering the star a red giant.</p>
            <p>Helium starts fusing together in the core, and once the helium is gone, the core contracts and becomes
                hotter, once more expanding the star but making it bluer and brighter than before, blowing away its
                outermost layers. After the expanding shells of gas fade, the remaining core is left, a white dwarf that
                consists mostly of carbon and oxygen with an initial temperature of roughly 180,000 degrees F (100,000
                degrees C). Since white dwarves have no fuel left for fusion, they grow cooler and cooler over billions
                of years to become black dwarves too faint to detect. Our sun should leave the main sequence in about 5
                billion years, according to Live Science.</p>
